Meeting someone you used to like or still like can bring a whirlwind of emotions: butterflies in your stomach, a racing heart and even avoiding eye contact. I experienced all of this today, during church service (*God, please do forgive me. I had a slightly hard time*).

It’s ironic of me to act this way, as I usually don’t ignore people. Yet, today, I did it and it didn't feel right. It wasn’t like me at all. Now, my inner child keeps asking, *why did you ignore her?*

Right, I went too fast to the point. Today, as usual, I went to church and sat in my regular spot, saving a seat for W. Five minutes before the service was set to begin, 'A' and her sister walked by and sat down in the seats infront of me. I knew it was her, but I did not say hi.

After the children's session ended, it was our turn to stand up and greet others, offering a sign of peace and saying hello. Hm, 'A' didn't turn her back to greet us. I was really tempted to go up and greet, but I did not. It was, unusual of me.

When the service ended, W and I left the church, and I thought to myself, why is it so hard to greet someone I liked, and maybe still do like, and just be friends? Trust me, the guilt level was so high. Trying to be myself while walking.

Earlier this year, 'A' broke my trust when I asked her not to share things I had only told a few people I deeply trust, yet she did. *Forgiveness? Trust me, I’m trying.*

The child within me was hoping that I did greeted, but the other part just did not allow that to happen. Sometimes I miss the simplicity of being a child, not weighed down by all these energy-draining small issues, you know? But at the same time, it's not worth putting effort into things that don't live up to what true friendship should be

What if opening up to someone who broke your trust is a sign of weakness? Maybe it’s just me, lost in my own world.

Maybe one day, I'll have the chance to say hi to her again, not because of any lingering feelings, but simply because we're all human.
