> 90% of ultrarunning is mental, and the rest is in your head.  -- Ray Zahab

I applied for the half marathon in KL Standard Chartered. The day before the run, I felt nervous. I couldn't sleep and kept thinking about what might happen. I remember telling a friend about my anxiety, and he said, "It's just a run. Why are you nervous?" This made me realize that those who have never run a marathon wouldn't understand

The day of the race arrived, and my starting point was Pen 3. With the countdown, the race began. About 8 to 10 kilometers in, I realized that I could get muscle cramps at any moment, so I decided to maintain my pace. Between kilometers 14 and 18, things got worse. Both of my legs experienced severe muscle cramps, which were incredibly painful. At that point, my mind was telling me to give up, and I had to fight my own mental enemy. It wasn't just the pain from the cramps; it was also the mental strength needed to push through. 

I had to take a short break and walk for a bit. The amount of ointment applied by the volunteers was quite amusing! The journey continued as I alternated between walking, jogging, and pushing myself mentally.

I finally pushed myself to the finishing line, and this time, I felt much more stable than before. Consistent training is the key.

**Why do I join marathons?** It’s because I have learned to love them. They help keep me fit while also training my mental endurance during tough times. We live in a world where chaos is part of everyone’s vocabulary. To endure it, especially during the most challenging times, mental strength is essential.

It's an experience everyone should have.
